# word2vec_numpy
A simple implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm using only Python and NumPy. Supports skip-gram architecture with negative sampling, custom window size, and basic monitoring of training progress. Ideal for learning how Word2Vec works internally without relying on high-level libraries.
